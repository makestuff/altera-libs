## Compile Intel/Altera core device libraries
You can git submodule this repo to allow you to compile the Intel/Altera core device libraries for Cyclone V and Stratix V. You will need this if you want to simulate any nontrivial project using ModelSim. See [`altera-pcie`](https://github.com/makestuff/altera-pcie) repo for an example of how to do this.
