## Compile Intel/Altera core device libraries
You can git submodule this repo to allow you to compile the Intel/Altera core device libraries for Cyclone V and Stratix V. You will need this if you want to simulate any nontrivial project using ModelSim.

See [BuildInfra](https://github.com/makestuff/ws-tools/blob/master/README.md) for details of how to incorporate this into your project.
